# Vislab XR Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will briefly work through the basic XR development using Unity3D, XR Interaction Toolkit, and AR foundation.

## Task

We will implement a mobile AR treasure hunting game. The goal of the game is to find a hidden treasure in the reality.

## Prerequiste

1. computer with Unity version 2021.3.13 lts (macOS must be used to build app for iOS) and empty space > 2gb
2. A mobile device (tablet or phone) with > 1gb empty space (iOS devices are more prefered)
3. usb that can connect your mobile devices and computer
4. code editor (visual studio is preferred, could be installed together with Unity)
5. web browser to download the skeleton code

## Task 1: Create a new project using Unity Hub

The first step is to creat a new project using Unity Hub. Fortunately, we have already prepared this template code with the necessary package installed (i.e., XR Interaction Toolkit and AR foundation). You may just simply download or clone this repository to your local computer. Then open the downloaded or cloned folder using Unity Hub.
